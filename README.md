# Machine Learning Project

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to delve into predictive analytics through machine learning on a dataset using Python in the Jupyter Notebook environment. 

- **Data Description:**
  - Read and describe the data using basic statistics and exposure to some natural language processing (NLP) terms.

- **Data Splitting:**
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Optionally, explore the opportunity to create multiple training and testing datasets for cross-validation.

- **Machine Learning:**
  - Conduct multi-class classification using Support Vector Machine/Regression (SVM).

- **Communication:**
  - Communicate the output of the analysis using the Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) measure.

- **Independent Model Evaluation:**
  - Experience independent model evaluation through submission for an in-class Kaggle competition.

## Data

- **Format:**
  - A single comma-separated (CSV) file.

- **Description:**
  - This data, derived from a set of essays, is structured to represent essay features in numeric information.

- **Pre-processing:**
  - The data is pre-processed and originates from a set of essays provided on Kaggle.
